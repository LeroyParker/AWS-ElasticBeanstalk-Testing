AWS-ElasticBeanstalk-Testing
============================

node.js test bundle for Beanstalk

The tutorial located at http://docs.aws.amazon.com/gettingstarted/latest/deploy/overview.html
is pretty much right on with the exception of the modifications.  While they have dropped a template HTML file into the bundle it is not used.  Look for index.jade in the views folder.
